					Once a havoc-prone country Bangladesh is now one of the fastest growing economies in the world. In less than five decades of its independence,
					Bangladesh has achieved all the indicators of millennium development goals several years ago while now it is heading rapidly to reach sustainable
					development goals (SDGs).

					However, absence of good practices in production, distribution and sales of goods and services to the consumers are among the major threats to
					this journey. Adulterated foods and substandard products are causing immense loss in all ways- health, environment and economic for the nation.

					A recent study conducted in Chattogram showed that some 55.63 percent of broiler chicks (poultry chicken) were infected with multi-drug resistant

					Physicians say that this disastrous situation has emerged due to different types of contamination in the food cycle of humans and animals.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4 text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-800 text-justify">
					Despite there are numerous laws and regulations to prevent contamination, no initiative is working currently. For example, Bangladesh is the
					first country in the world to impose ban on using polythene in 2002. But the country is not getting any benefit due to its poor implementation.

					So only making law is not enough always. Mass awareness is the main key. And CCS has been trying its best to aware people in this regard.

				<p class="mb-4 text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-800 text-justify">
					In this context, Conscious Consumer Society (CCS) has been working to be a part of nation's effort to make the development safer, sustainable,
					happier, and accessible to all through creating a social movement to protect the rights of the consumers.
